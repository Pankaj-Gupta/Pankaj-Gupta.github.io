<ol style="list-style-type: circle">
<li> <b>Coordinator, Android App Development </b> <i>(Internship done under Svagatagami Association, NPO)</i>
</br>  Android Apps were developed for children with problems like mental retardation, autism, hyperactivity &
Attention Deficit Disorder. Apps won 1st prize in SoCha competition of E-Summit, IIT Kanpur
</li>

<li>Research Crawler <i>(Project done as a Winter Internship under a Startup) </i>
</br> Research papers were collected through crawling of Bing and Spider-crawl and then they were clustered to
discover patterns
</li>

<li> <b> Dropout Method for Neural Networks </b> <i> (Project done under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering and Prof.
Sharmishtha Mitra, Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</b> Dropout method of randomly omitting hidden nodes to improve efficiency was examined
</li>

<li>Modelling of Earth's Gravitational Field <i>(Project done under Professor Akash Anand, Department of Mathematics & Statistics, IIT
Kanpur) </i>
</br> EGM-2008 model of Earth's Gravitation Field was modelled in Matlab and implemented in spherical & cartesian co-ordinates
</li>

<li>Cloud Pad <i>(Project done under Electronics Club ,IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Implemented real-time gaming using UDP protocol via Socket Programming
</li>

<li>Connexion <i>(App developed in Yahoo HackU-2013 ,IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Implemented a Web-scraping based model in python in which given any two movie-personalities, it shows
the connections between them in form of common movies, significant years or any other relation.
</li>

<li>Carrom <i>(Project done under Programming Club ,IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> 
AI based implementation of Carrom game in Python using pygame module
</li>

<li>Ping Pong Game <i>(Project done under Professor Piyush P. Kurur, Department of Computer Science & Engineering,
IIT Kanpur) </i>
Implementation of Ping Pong Game using pygame module of Python.
</li>

<li>3-D Building Modelling <i> (Project done under MAAC Animation and Animation Club, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Complete 3d model of Academic Affairs building of IIT Kanpur was made using 3ds-max software.
</li>

<li>Calculator <i> (Made in Takneek'11 Electronics Club, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Made a calculator using basic IC's which performed addition, subtraction and multiplication-division(by 2).
</li>

<li>Wall following Robot <i> (Made in Techkriti under Robotics Club, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Made an autonomous robot which has to traverse a path by following a wall in compliance with the rules provided
</li>

<li>Chariot-model <i> (Made under course TA201, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Made a real-model of chariot using techniques like casting, welding, plate cutting. etc.
</li>

<li>Mixer-grinder <i> (Made under course TA202, IIT Kanpur) </i>
</br> Made a simple mixer-grinder using techniques like milling, turning, shaping, grinding, metal-cutting, etc
</li>

</ol>
